        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Growing up, my favourite lunch on a Saturday afternoon was - you guessed it - beans on toast. There was something about the sauce and beans that really just tasted good.</p>
        <p>This recipe is especially delicious if you use fresh sourdough bread (made from scratch or from the bakery), and you can optionally sprinkle cheddar cheese on top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Baked beans (any brand)</li>
            <li>Bread (sourdough preferred)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the beans on a low heat, making sure to stir regularly. Do not let the beans reach a boil as this impacts the flavour and texture negatively.</li>
            <li>Toast your bread to your preferred browness.</li>
            <li>Butter the hot toast.</li>
            <li>Pour baked beans evenly over the buttered toast.</li>
            <li>Grate cheese over the beans on toast to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
