        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Growing up, my second favourite lunch on a Saturday afternoon was - you guessed it - tomato soup. There was something about the tomatoey goodness that really just tasted good.</p>
        <p>This recipe is especially delicious if you use fresh sourdough bread (made from scratch or from the bakery) to dip into the soup.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomato soup</li>
            <li>Bread (sourdough preferred)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the soup on a low heat, making sure to stir regularly. Do not let the soup reach a boil as this impacts the flavour and texture negatively.</li>
            <li>Put your bread on a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour soup into a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
